/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Pretty little buttons or messages to tell you
        what to click

        -Implemented: Everything within project requirements

        -Partly implemented: Functions to mess with board, didn't add kill

    Bugs: None as of now

    Reflections: Project was insanely difficult, wish the professor explained
    how each piece fits in the puzzle. I won't call it spoonfeeding because
    I have no idea how SFML works and spending this much time learning
    how grid can interact with SFML was very difficult. Suprisingly, the
    logic to mess with the board wasn't too bad.
